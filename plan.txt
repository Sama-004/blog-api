Basic: 
Your blog should have posts and comments, so think about the fields you are going to want to include for each of those.
you are going to require users to leave a username with their comments
you are going to display a date or a timestamp for posts and comments
No title for comments only content



Admin: 
Create a second website for authoring and editing your posts. You can set this up however you like but the following features might be useful:
A list of all posts that shows whether or not they have been published.
A button to publish unpublished posts, or to unpublish published ones!
A ‘NEW POST’ form. If you want to get fancy, you could use a rich text editor such as TinyMCE.
The ability to manage comments (i.e. delete or edit them).


Additional: 

A useful feature for a blog is the ability to have posts that are in the database but not published for the public to read. How might you designate published vs unpublished posts in your DB
